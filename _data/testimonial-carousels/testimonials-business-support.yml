    quote: Essex is also convenient for London. The train service makes it easy to meet clients based in the City or visit our head office. Overseas visitors find Essex just as easy to reach as London because weâ€™ve got international airports at Stansted and Southend so close by. The location ticked all the boxes, and the support we received from INVEST Essex gave us the confidence to make the final decision. In the end, there was no competition.
