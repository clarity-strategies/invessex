DP World’s London Gateway Port has announced the launching of its first Asian liner service to be served by a global container shipping consortium, ‘THE Alliance’. The launch of ‘THE Alliance’ will see DP World London Gateway Port handling the largest ships in the world.

The new alliance will provide new Asia-Europe and transatlantic services from the UK at DP World-operated terminals from April 2017\. With two new regular Asia-Europe services the port will now offer the widest choice to shippers on North-South and East-West trade lanes.

> “This is a strong endorsement of UK industry. We are proud that ‘THE Alliance’ has chosen to make all of its UK calls at DP World terminals from April and we strongly believe that DP World in the UK is best placed to offer the consortium and its customers the very best service.”
> 
> Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, CEO and Chairman, DP World

### Providing competitive shipping services

DP World London Gateway is linked to an unrivalled global shipping network, providing competitive global shipping options. The unrivalled geographical location, excellent road and rail connectivity of the terminal help make the UK more competitive for importers and exporters.

> “Never before has moving goods from A to B been so demanding. Retailers and manufacturers depend on swift, slick, efficient, reliable and highly complex supply chains. At DP World, we recognise that we are an integral part of that supply chain. In the UK, our customers now have the choice of two deep-water ports, operated by one company, providing them with multiple benefits to their UK supply chain.”
> 
> Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, CEO and Chairman, DP World

### Expanding to meet rising demand

Following the launch of the new ‘THE Alliance’ service DP World’s London Gateway Port has announced of opening the third deep-sea berth. The third berth will provide additional capacity for shipping lines and cargo owners in retail, engineering and automotive sectors and will ensure DP World continues to provide a world-class service to its global supply chain customers.

The third deep-sea berth in DP World London Gateway port is planned to open in late March 2017.

> “DP World is the only operator in the UK to provide two deep-water facilities. Both terminals can provide operational back up to each other and reduce the risk of delays to the supply chain - no other operator in the UK can do this.”
> 
> Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, CEO and Chairman, DP World

The port is integrated with DP World London Gateway Logistics Park, which provides nearly one million square metres of supply chain and distribution space for retailers and logistics firms, such as Lidl and UPS, who are already on site.

London Gateway Logistics Park is located just to the east of DP World’s London Gateway Port, where a 560 acre area of land is under development which will become Europe’s largest logistics park. The logistics park has been planned to sit directly behind the dockside freight handling facilities and has full multi-modal transport infrastructure.

This combination of a deep-sea port and logistics park offers a port-centric solution in the best location with…

*   Unrivalled facilities
*   Tri-modal connectivity
*   Unmatched safety, speed and reliability
