Essex is an integral extension of London’s world-leading finance cluster, crucial for Financial and Professional Services companies.  From a reduced-cost Essex base, businesses can access the City of London in as little as 30 minutes and enjoy fast data connectivity and therefore high-speed trading.

### The local skills base offers…

*   The second highest concentration of finance and insurance workers in the EU
*   A pool of 413,000 finance workers – 1/3 of the UK’s total supply
*   A location next to London, Europe’s no.1 finance hub
*   Over 7,000 students enrolled in finance and business related degrees each year giving investors access to a highly talented, youthful workforce

Some of the many reasons why Essex has been selected as a business location by leading financial services and outsourcing companies including Liverpool Victoria (LV), Royal Sun Alliance (RSA), Cofunds, First Data, [International Financial Data Services (IFDS)](http://investessex.co.uk/studies/case-studies/international-financial-data-services-ifds), MS Amlin and [Ventrica](http://investessex.co.uk/studies/case-studies/ventrica).

Essex based financial services companies are also working in tandem with academics in Essex. Insurance company, the Hood Group, have recently received government backing for an AI project which will see data scientists from the [University of Essex](http://investessex.co.uk/studies/place-studies/the-university-of-essex) working with the company to innovate insurance through data.

The business professional financial services sector is a growing sector in Essex. Fintech company [Thames Card Technology](http://investessex.co.uk/studies/case-studies/thames-card-technology), one of the UK’s largest plastic card manufacturers, has seen demand in their services increase with the surge in electronic and contactless payments and Bibby, the UK’s largest independent invoice finance provider, has just announced their expansion.
