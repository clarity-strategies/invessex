### Business advantage of London Stansted Airport

{% include right-image.html src="https://res.cloudinary.com/investessex/image/upload/Stansted_security_400.jpg" width="400" caption="London Stansted Airport new security hall" %}

In the coming months London Stansted Airport will pass the 25 million passengers a year mark. This increase in passenger numbers is partly due to the recent return of long haul flights to the airport and an increase in business travellers. London Stansted Airport is advantageously positioned for business travellers. It is seen as a core transport hub with unparalleled access to the M11 corridor with a reach of 17 million people within 2 hours and 1.2 million within 30 minutes.

> “In the coming months we will also see Stansted pass the 25 million passengers a year for the first time ever, another milestone achievement for the airport.”
> 
> Andrew Cowan, CEO, London Stansted Airport

### London-Stansted-Cambridge economic corridor

The thriving catchment area is part of the growing and increasingly successful London-Stansted-Cambridge economic corridor. The area has strong infrastructure links to the rest of the UK, Europe and international markets offering close proximity to London, Europe’s no.1 finance hub. The most popular destinations were Spain, Italy, Germany and Poland but the biggest year-on-year growth came from Denmark, Bulgaria and Cyprus. May saw the arrival of two new airlines, BMI Regional offering a twice daily service to the City of Derry, and Arkia Israeli Airlines who launched flights to Tel Aviv.

> "The airport sits at the heart of the London-Stansted-Cambridge growth corridor, and with the region booming and London’s economic activity shifting towards the east, Stansted is ideally placed to support businesses trading internationally and looking to compete in the global market place.”
> 
>Conan Busby, Business Development Manager, MAG Cargo
