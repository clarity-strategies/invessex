> “I am personally delighted to be back at Chesterford, having been CEO at Solexa; pioneers of next-generation sequencing and a previous occupier at the Park that eventually went on to become part of Illumina.  Our CSO, Joe Brennan, was also part of the Solexa team and we have enjoyed a long and successful association with Chesterford and one which we look forward to continuing as we develop Evonetix.”

### About Evonetix

{% include right-image.html width="400" src="//res.cloudinary.com/investessex/image/upload/Evonetix_20170207_150058_400.jpg" caption="Evonetix DNA sequencer" %}

Evonetix, a spinout from Cambridge Consultants, Cambridge’s largest and oldest contract research and development (R&D) company, was founded in late 2015\. The company focuses on developing a novel method of manufacturing synthetic DNA molecules with high accuracy, using a microchip-based array. Accurate DNA synthesis is important at many stages of drug discovery and development, because…

*   It helps researchers to understand the mechanism of a disease in different patients and how a drug interacts with it
*   It allows cells to be engineered so they actually become manufacturing units for biopharmaceuticals
*   It allows cell-based assays to be developed for accurate prediction of responses to a drug

### Investors first project in Essex

Evonetix are backed by Amadeus Capital Partners, the venture capital (VC) company founded by Hermann Hauser, who has successfully been involved with previous investments such as ARM, Cambridge Silicon Radio, Xaar, Domino Printing Sciences and Solexa. This is the first Amadeus Capital Partners investment to be located in Essex.
