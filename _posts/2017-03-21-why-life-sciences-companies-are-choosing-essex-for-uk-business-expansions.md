Located between Cambridge and London, Essex is emerging as popular location for expanding life sciences companies. Along with direct access to both Cambridge and London, key advantages for businesses include reduced costs, diverse technology competencies and excellent transport connectivity.

Arecor is just one company that has identified Essex as its ideal UK location for business growth. A leader in biopharmaceuticals development, Arecor is set to move into its new accommodation at [Chesterford Research Park](http://investessex.co.uk/studies/place-studies/chesterford-research-park1), Essex, in October 2016\. The location is already home to a number of innovative biotech and pharmaceutical companies including Isogenica and Illumina, and that’s just one of the advantages the company saw in the science park.

> “Arecor is experiencing significant growth and we required enhanced facilities that could meet our expansion requirements, both today and well into the future. We selected Chesterford because of the quality of innovative companies already located here; the Park’s location within the Cambridge cluster and the excellent central facilities.”
> 
> Dr Sarah Howell, CEO, Arecor

Just a 30 minute drive from Cambridge, <sup>[1]</sup> Chesterford is a key location within the city’s life sciences ecosystem, and the wider cluster in Greater South East England. The Park is also a key location within the ‘London-Stansted-Cambridge Corridor’ – identified as an emerging growth area for life sciences businesses. These location advantages are combining to make Essex a significant centre of life sciences research and innovation.

Access to specialist skills was a deciding factor for Aceror.

> “Attracting top talent as we continue to grow is key to our future success and we feel that Chesterford is the ideal location from which we can continue to forge ahead.”

> Dr Sarah Howell, CEO, Arecor

Essex is well-positioned to provide the highly skilled people and knowledge life sciences companies need. In addition to the University of Essex and Anglia Ruskin University, the county provides fast access to 3 of the world’s top-10 ranked universities: the University of Cambridge, University College London (UCL) and Imperial College London. <sup>[2]</sup>

### About Arecor

{% include right-image.html src="//res.cloudinary.com/investessex/image/upload/Diabetes_care_400.jpg" width="400" caption="Diabetes care"%}

A leader in the development of superior biopharmaceuticals, Arecor has developed an innovative formulation platform Arestat™, allowing them to develop exclusive products within the health technology sector. Their focus is on improved treatments for diabetes care through the reformulation of approved proteins and peptides. These products will enable next-generation technology and, most importantly, improve quality of life for those with diabetes.

Future device technology such as wearable patch pumps and implants that can administer continuous insulin doses are vital developments for those living with the condition. Through improvement of glycemic control and compliance, cases of diabetes-related problems including hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) can be decreased. The devices would also improve morality rates and complications linked to the condition.

In order to further its research and development portfolio beyond its internal products, Arecor teams up with other leading pharmaceutical and biotech companies to produce superior reformulations of their own products, which could not be made possible by simply using conventional formulation science.
