The Costa Coffee chain has opened its new £38m roastery in response to growing demand for Costa’s coffee and to provide the infrastructure for sustained global expansion. The company chose to locate their first roastery outside of London in Basildon due to the close location to Tilbury Docks where the firm’s raw coffee beans are imported.

The new facility named ‘Paradise Street’ is Europe's biggest coffee roastery covering 85,690 sq ft, the equivalent of over 30 tennis courts. The roastery has more than quadrupled Costa’s roasting capacity and will help Costa in their ambition to expand globally.

> “Costa is growing rapidly as a global business and our new roastery will provide the platform for sustained international expansion as we continue inspiring the world to love great coffee.”
> 
> Dominic Paul, Managing Director, Costa

### About the roastery

{% include right-image.html src="//res.cloudinary.com/investessex/image/upload/v1498919336/Giorgio_Fioravanti_by_the_roasters_400.jpg" width="400" caption="Giorgio Fioravanti by the roasters" %}

Costa’s roasting capacity has more than quadrupled at the new roastery going from 11,000 tonnes to 45,000 tonnes of coffee per year. This will enable Costa to produce coffee for 2.1 billion cups of coffee per annum. The new facility also includes a coffee academy to train 3,000 baristas per year.

‘Paradise Street’ will also be one of the most sustainable industrial buildings in the world. On site renewable energy generation and a rainwater harvesting system will further reduce the building’s carbon footprint, provide power for the roaster and generate hot water for the building. 

### Investing in an efficient supply chain

Construction of the new roastery started in November 2015 and the Basildon site was specially chosen due to the close location to Tilbury Docks where the firm’s raw coffee beans are imported. The Costa’s new roastery is 14 miles from the Port of Tilbury and 18 miles from central London, that makes the new venture more efficient in its supply chain thereby minimising food miles as well as increasing roasting capacity.

> “Turning on our new roasting capacity is a landmark for the business. Roasting here in Basildon keeps the UK at the centre of our growing global brand and enables us to build on everything we have learnt from more than four decades of roasting in Lambeth. Today is about quality, capacity, investing in the future and being true to our heritage. It’s about embracing our traditions whilst continuing to innovate and drive global growth.”

> Dominic Paul, Managing Director, Costa

### Future plans

The UK is a very strong market for Costa Coffee and the hub of their national and international business. The new roastery, which is expected to operate over the next 20 to 30 years, could see a rise in its annual roasting capacity from 45,000 tonnes to 60,000 tonnes in the future and projected sales of £2.5 billion by 2020.

> “When we were designing the roastery we had to focus on the long term. We are now able to produce 45,000 tonnes of coffee every year, with the future potential to expand to 60,000 tonnes.
> 
> This excellent new facility will enable Costa to grow for decades to come, as we look to go from the UK’s favourite coffee brand to the world’s favourite. The latest roasting technology we have here will help us to do that, slowly and carefully roasting every coffee bean to seal in the unique flavour of our coffee.”
