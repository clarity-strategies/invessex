<h3 style="margin-top: 0px;">Introduction</h3>
<p>Establishing operations at UK Multimodal Gateway: Essex can enable logistics and distribution businesses to minimise costs, emissions and risks, maximise flexibility and efficiency in transport planning, and ‘future-proof’ supply chains.</p>
<p>Essex combines more than 1,000 acres of port-adjacent, tri-modally connected logistics and distribution sites with a specialist logistics workforce and fast access to UK, European and global markets – by road, rail, sea and air.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Global, Multimodal<br>Transport Connectivity</h3>
<p>Locating in Essex provides logistics and distribution businesses with world-class multimodal infrastructure and global transport connectivity:</p>
<ul>
  <li>4 major sea ports: London Gateway, Tilbury, Harwich and Purfleet ports offer large freight capacities, high-frequency deep-sea and short-sea services and the ability to handle all cargo types - lo-lo (containers), ro-ro (ferries), general, dry bulk, liquid bulk and vehicles.</li>
  <li>6 portside rail freight terminals provide businesses with high-frequency connections to distribution hubs and markets in the UK and continental Europe (via the Channel Tunnel)</li>
  <li>6 London airports within 1.30 hours’ HGV drive time, including the UK’s No.1 and No.3 air freight hubs by capacity: - London Heathrow (LHR) and London Stansted (in Essex, less than 1 hour from the county’s key portcentric sites)</li>
  <li>Direct motorway access to UK and European markets via the M25 London orbital motorway: just 30 minutes’ HGV drive time from Essex’s key portcentric sites&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Access to high-value markets - direct access to the UK’s (and one of Europe’s) largest and highest income markets (London and South East England).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Portcentric<br>Logistics Sites</h3>
<p>Essex offers more than 1,000 acres of tri-modally connected, portcentric or port-adjacent logistics sites available for development – significantly more logistics space than competitor UK portcentric locations can offer.</p>
<p>Essex’s key portcentric, tri-modal logistics sites include . . .</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>London Gateway Logistics park, Thurrock -</strong> 560 acres / 9 million sq ft of development land with planning in place, accommodating units up to 1 million+ sq ft.</li>
  <li><strong>Thames Enterprise Park, Thurrock -</strong> up to 400 acres of logistics space, available for development.</li>
  <li><strong>London Distribution Park, Tilbury -</strong> 700 acres / 900,000 sq ft of development land to accommodate units up to 670,000 sq ft. ‘Ready to go’ with infrastructure in place.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Portcentric<br>Cost Savings</h3>
<p>Portcentric distribution from Essex to major UK markets can deliver significant, measurable cost savings for logistics and distribution businesses, compared with the traditional UK ‘central distribution centre’ model.</p>
<p>According to industry research (by Drewry, based on London Gateway) shipping to, and portcentric distribution from, Essex portcentric sites can reduce round-trip transport costs by . . .</p>
<ul>
	<li>Around <strong>£189 savings per container </strong>shipped to London and the South East</li>
	<li>Around<strong> £59 savings per container</strong> shipped to the Midlands and North West</li>
</ul>
<p>For businesses serving European and global markets, Essex’s cost-effectiveness is further enhanced by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Europe’s best major location for ‘ease of doing business’ – the UK (World Bank)</li>
  <li>Significant labour cost savings versus major continental European logistics hubs including Rotterdam, Hamburg and Antwerp</li>
  <li>A more flexible labour market (UK) than any continental European competitor country (World Bank)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Large-Scale, Skilled<br>Logistics Workforce</h3>
<p>Essex (Thurrock) offers a logistics workforce that is outstanding in the UK, with more workers than competitor UK locations in the key logistics categories of ‘Elementary Occupations’, ‘Transport and Storage’ and ‘Skilled Trades’ (as % of total workforce) (ONS, 2015).</p>
<p>Additionally, Essex offers a larger available workforce for logistics occupations – a measured by unemployment – than competitor UK locations including Felixstowe, Northamptonshire, Warwickshire and Leicestershire</p>
<h3>Logistics Education,<br>Training &amp; Expertise</h3>
<p>Essex’s higher and further education institutions work in close partnership with the county’s ports and logistics businesses to deliver a skilled, qualified logistics workforce . . .</p>
<p><strong>Essex Business School (University Of Essex) </strong>delivers ports and logistics-related post-graduate courses including ‘Global Supply Chain and Operations Management’ and ‘Supply Chain and Logistics – Technology Management’</p>
<p><strong>South Essex College</strong> delivers a Level 3 Diploma in ‘Business, Logistics and Supply Chain’ from its new £45 million Thurrock Campus.</p>
